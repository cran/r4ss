\usage{
SSexecutivesummary(dir, plotdir = "default", quant = 0.95,
  es.only = FALSE, tables = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h",
  "i", "catch", "numbers"), nsex = FALSE, endyr = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dir}{Locates the directory of the files to be read in, double
backslashes (or forwardslashes) and quotes necessary.}

\item{plotdir}{Directory where the 'tables' directory will be created.
The default is the dir location where the Report.sso file is located.}

\item{quant}{To calculate confidence intervals, default is set at 0.95}

\item{es.only}{TRUE/FALSE switch to produce only the executive summary tables
will be produced, default is FALSE which will return all executive summary
tables, historical catches, and numbers-at-ages}

\item{tables}{Which tables to produce (default is everything). Note: some
tables depend on calculations related to previous tables, so will fail
if requested on their own (e.g. Table 'f' can't be created
without also creating Table 'a')}

\item{nsex}{This will allow the user to calculate single sex values
based on the new sex
specification (-1) in SS for single sex models. Default value is FALSE.
TRUE will not divide by 2.}

\item{endyr}{Optional input to choose a different ending year for tables
(could be useful for catch-only updates)}

\item{verbose}{Return updates of function progress to the R console?}
}
\value{
A csv files containing executive summary tables.
}
\description{

}
\arguments{
\item{replist}{list created by \code{\link{SS_output}}}

\item{plot}{plot to active plot device?}

\item{print}{print to PNG files?}

\item{plotdir}{directory where PNG files will be written. by default it will
be the directory where the model was run.}

\item{fleetcol}{Either the string "default", or a vector of colors to use
for each fleet.}

\item{datatypes}{Either the string "all", or a vector including some subset
of the following: "catch", "cpue", "lendbase", "sizedbase", "agedbase",
"condbase", "ghostagedbase", "ghostcondbase", "ghostlendbase", "ladbase",
"wadbase", "mnwgt", "discard", "tagdbase1", "tagdbase2".}

\item{fleets}{Either the string "all", or a vector of numerical values, like
c(1,3), listing fleets or surveys to be included in the plot.}

\item{fleetnames}{A vector of alternative names to use in the plot. By
default the parameter names in the data file are used.}

\item{ghost}{TRUE/FALSE indicator for whether to show presence of
composition data from ghost fleets (data for which the fit is shown, but is
not included in the likelihood calculations).}

\item{pwidth}{width of plot written to PNG file}

\item{pheight}{height of plot written to PNG file}

\item{punits}{units for PNG file}

\item{res}{resolution for PNG file}

\item{ptsize}{ptsize for PNG file}

\item{cex.main}{character expansion for plot titles}

\item{margins}{margins of plot (passed to par() function), which may need to
be increased if fleet names run off right-hand margin}

\item{cex}{Character expansion for points showing isolated years of data}

\item{lwd}{Line width for lines showing ranges of years of data}

\item{verbose}{report progress to R GUI?}

\description{
Plot shows graphical display of what data is being used in the model.  Some
data types may not yet be included. Note, this is based on output from the
model, not the input data file.

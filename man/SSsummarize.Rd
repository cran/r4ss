\title{
  Summarize the output from multiple Stock Synthesis models.
}
\description{
  Summarize various quantities from the model output collected by
  \code{\link{SSgetoutput}} and return them in a list of tables and
  vectors.
}
\usage{
SSsummarize(biglist, keyvec = NULL, numvec = NULL, selfactor =
c("Lsel"), selfleet = NULL, selyear = "min", selgender = 1, filter=TRUE,
growthyr = 1971)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{biglist}{
    A list of lists created by \code{\link{SSgetoutput}}.
  }
  \item{keyvec}{
    Optional list of strings matching names of elements of biglist to
    subset. Default=NULL.
  }
  \item{numvec}{
    Optional list of numbers of elements from biglist to subset.
    Default=NULL.
  }
  \item{selfactor}{
    A string or vector of strings indicating which elements of the
    selectivity at length output to summarize. Default=c("Lsel").
  }
  \item{selfleet}{
    Vector of fleets for which selectivity will be summarized. NULL=all fleets. Default=NULL.
  }
  \item{selyear}{
    String or vector of years for which selectivity will be summarized. NULL=all
    years, "min" = first year, "max" = last year.  Default="min".
  }
  \item{selgender}{
    Vector of genders (1 and/or 2) for which selectivity will be summarized. NULL=all genders. Default=NULL.
  }
  \item{filter}{
    Switch to control whether columns in derived quantities are filtered
    so they match between models with different numbers of estimated
    parameters. Warning: not generalized at all.
  }
  \item{growthyr}{
    Single year for which growth is to be summarized. Default=1971
    (works for Ian's application, but needs to be generalized).
